Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work!

To perform a complicated task, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect.

Great care must be taken to choose assumptions that are realistic, so that the resulting conclusions are not misleading. However, making assumptions about data can be productive when doing so allows inference techniques to apply to novel situations."
