    "**Lab Queue**: You can find the Lab Queue at [lab.data8.org](https://lab.data8.org/). Whenever you feel stuck or need some further clarification, add yourself to the queue to get help from a GSI or academic intern! If you are in an online lab, please list your name, breakout room number, and purpose on your ticket!\n",

    "The two building blocks of Python code are *expressions* and *statements*.  An **expression** is a piece of code that\n",

    "* is self-contained, meaning it would make sense to write it on a line by itself, and\n",
    "* usually evaluates to a value.\n",

    "    3\n",
    "    5 - 2\n",
    "    \n",
    "One important type of expression is the **call expression**. A call expression begins with the name of a function and is followed by the argument(s) of that function in parentheses. The function returns some value, based on its arguments. Some important mathematical functions are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Function | Description                                                   |\n",
    "|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| `abs`      | Returns the absolute value of its argument                    |\n",
    "| `max`      | Returns the maximum of all its arguments                      |\n",
    "| `min`      | Returns the minimum of all its arguments                      |\n",
    "| `pow`      | Raises its first argument to the power of its second argument |\n",

    "The expression `2 - 5` and the two call expressions given above are examples of **compound expressions**, meaning that they are actually combinations of several smaller expressions.  `2 - 5` combines the expressions `2` and `5` by subtraction.  In this case, `2` and `5` are called **subexpressions** because they're expressions that are part of a larger expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **statement** is a whole line of code.  Some statements are just expressions.  The expressions listed above are examples.\n",

    "Other statements *make something happen* rather than *having a value*. For example, an **assignment statement** assigns a value to a name. \n",

    "    absolute_height_difference = abs(height - 1.688)\n",
    "\n",
    "An important idea in programming is that large, interesting things can be built by combining many simple, uninteresting things.  The key to understanding a complicated piece of code is breaking it down into its simple components.\n",
